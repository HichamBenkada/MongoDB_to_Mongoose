# ALAB 319.5.1: Working with Mongoose

Version 1.0, 07/31/23
GitHub Repo.:  [Click here](https://github.com/HichamBenkada/MongoDB_to_Mongoose) to open in a separate window.

## Introduction: 

This is a Node.js project is build using MongoDB native driver and my objective is to refactor the existing application, changing from the standard MongoDB Node driver to Mongoose.

## Objective:

- Downloading the final example here in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/express-building-a-restful-api-9-hg34yn)
- Renaming the project directory as appropriate.
- Running git init to establish a git repository within the directory.
- Running npm install to install the application dependencies.
- Adding my own environment variables to enable connection to Mongo database.
- Testing the application by running nodemon index.js and navigating to localhost:3000.
- Commiting frequently to my Git repository throughout the assignment,


### Part 1: Exploring Existing Operations
Taking a few minutes to explore the existing code and Making sure I am familiar with the structure and functionality of what I will be working with.This step is very important whenever I am given somebody else's code to work on, it is crucial to take the appropriate time to understand it before attempting modifications and improvements.

### Part 2: Refactoring to Mongoose
My task is to completely remove the MongoDB driver from the application, and instead, use Mongoose for all database interactions.

Something to remember, I can add additional features along the way of refactoring this code while preserving the application functionality as the original.

thinking about what I should change first. I did not delete the MongoDB driver code immediately! Instead I commented it out to use it as a reference and I continue to code alongside it in order to ensure I have everything in place.

<!-- 
make a module schema grades module...validation... add a user module relationship vertual property and static methodes and 
 -->
### Part 3: Testing
Testing my application's functionality and making sure that everything works as expected.
If my code does not work, I left comments for myself explaining potential next steps, so I can revisit the application in the future and approach the problem again from a new perspective.

### Part 4: Completion
The project is successfully pushed to Github using git version control and the repository link is submitted to Canvas, the PerScholas assignment folder.

_Thank you for your time! looking forward to hear your comments and tips how to improve and make this project better_
